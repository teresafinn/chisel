# Chisel

What is it? 
-----------
The Chisel program is a simple markdown parser. Chisel accepts input from users on the command line. Input should be any length string in markdown. Chisel will convert the user's string to output in HTML and print it to the command line. It allows for h1-h6 headers, emphasis and strong tags, and finally ordered and unordered lists. This was quite fun to build!

How to Use
----------
Run Chisel from the command line by typing `ruby chisel.rb`. It will ask you to enter your input and then pass this input into the Chisel's parse method. The program will then output HTML. Viola! 

I Learned How to...
------------
- Split code into multiple files and require/require_relative in order to use those files
- Use case statements
- Break program components into multiple methods
- Use TDD with Minitest to guide program development
